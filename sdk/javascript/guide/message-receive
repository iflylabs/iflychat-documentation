iFlyChat JavaScript SDK fires an event named 'message-receive' whenever a new message is received. You may bind to this event in following manner:

~~~
iflychat.on('message-receive', function(message) {
  
  /* your code here - message object contains received message information */

});
~~~

Here message is a JS object with following properties:

*fromId
*fromName
*toId
*toName
*message
*messageId
